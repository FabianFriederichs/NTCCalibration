# NTCCalibration
This is a python script for calibrating NTC thermistors as they are found in 3D printer hotends.
The user supplies some measured temperature / ADC value pairs and some meta information.
A steinhart-hart model is fitted to the data points and a lookup table over temperatures and
ADC values is extrapolated from this.

## How to get Data?
In case of the [Marlin](https://marlinfw.org/) firmware, you can query current ADC readings
using the gcode commands `M105` or `M155`. In the advanced configuration header (*Configuration_adv.h*),
`SHOW_TEMP_ADC_VALUES` must be defined to get raw ADC readings along with the temperatures.

For temperature data, a thermocouple-based thermometer is a good option.
To get the most accurate readings, drill a small hole into the side of your nozzle and place
the thermocouple in there. I also had luck with simply holding it firmly into the nozzle orifice.

3 temperature / ADC pairs are enough in theory, but the more datapoints you acquire, the better
the fit of the model will be. Currently the model is fitted using a simple least squares approach,
therefore it is beneficial to filter out any obvious outliers.

A fairly quick procedure to generate enough data points I found is the following:
1. Start at room temperature and set the extruder temperature to the highest, safe value for your setup.
2. Record temperature and ADC values in 5 or 10 degree steps
3. When the target temperature is reached, turn off heating and again record data points every 5 or 10 degrees
    until a temperature close to room temp is reached
4. Average the results from step 2 and 3 to reduce the error due to temperature lag in the system.

## Steinhart-Hart Model
The general Steinhart-Hart equation is used to model the dependency between an NTC thermistor's
resistance and the temperature in Kelvin:

The powers (i) actually used can vary, but 0 (constant), 1 (linear) and 3 (cubic) is the most common
configuration.

## Running the Script
The main python script is *generate_ntc_lut.py*.
Here is an example command line for creating a LUT from the values in *volcano_thermistor_measurements.csv*:
```
python generate_ntc_lut.py --input_file volcano_thermistor_measurements.csv --output_file volcano_thermistor_table.csv --source_adc_res 12 --target_adc_res 10 --reference_voltage 3.3 --pull_up_resistance 4700 --sample_temp_start 0 --sample_temp_end 300 --sample_temp_step 10
```

## Command Line Parameters

**--input_file** [req] Two-column CSV file with temperature values in the first and ADC readings in the second    column.

**--output_file** [opt] Two-column CSV file with sampled temperature values in the first and corresponding ADC values in the second column. If this argument is not given, no output is saved and the LUT is printed in the console.

**--source_adc_res** [req] Resolution of the input ADC values in bits. When using Marlin, this can be looked up in the corresponding *HAL.h* header below the respective directory for your platform (e.g. *Marlin/src/HAL/LPC1768/HAL.h*). Search for `HAL_ADC_RESOLUTION`.

**--target_adc_res** [req] Resolution in bits of the ADC values stored in the final LUT. For Marlin this is usually 10.

**--reference_voltage** [req] Reference voltage of the ADC. When using Marlin, this can be looked up in the corresponding *HAL.h* header below the respective directory four your platform (e.g. *Marlin/src/HAL/LPC1768/HAL.h*). Search for `HAL_ADC_VREF`.

**--pull_up_resistance** [req] Pullup resistor value of the voltage divider used to measure the thermistor voltage. Can be found in the schematic of the board in question.

**--sample_temp_start** [opt] Lowest temperature entry in the final LUT. Defaults to 0 째C.

**--sample_temp_end** [opt] Highest temperature entry in the final LUT. Defaults to 100 째C.

**--sample_temp_step** [opt] Step size of the final LUT. Defaults to 10 째C.

**--steinhart_hart_powers** [opt] Comma separated list of powers to use in the Steinhart-Hart Model. Defaults to *0,1,3*

**--temp_in_kelvin** [opt] Flag that specifies that temperatures are given in Kelvin instead of 째C.

**--extrapolation_max_iterations** [opt] Maximum number of iterations to use when doing numerical inversion of the model for building the LUT. Defaults to 1000.

**--extrapolation_tolerance** [opt] Maximum allowable temperature error when doing numericaal inversion of the model for building the LUT. Defaults to 1e-6.

**--noplot** [opt] Flag that disables a plot being shown at the end of the model fitting.

## Adding a Custom Thermistor to Marlin (successfully tested with 2.1.1)

1. Copy one of the named thermistor headers, e.g. *Marlin/src/module/thermistor/thermistor_5.h* and give it a new number, e.g. *Marlin/src/module/thermistor/thermistor_**3000**.h*.
2. In the new header file, change the name of the LUT accordingly, e.g. `temptable_5` -> `temptable_3000`.
3. Add entries from the ouput CSV file.
4. In the header file *Marlin/src/module/thermistor/thermistors.h* add an entry like this:
```C++
#if ANY_THERMISTOR_IS(3000) // Entry for the new thermistor
  #include "thermistor_3000.h" // Include the corresponding header file containing the LUT
#endif
```
5. In *Marlin/src/lcd/thermistornames.h* add the new thermistor name:
```C++
#elif THERMISTOR_ID == 3000
  #define THERMISTOR_NAME "New Thermistor Name"
```
6. Recompile and flash the modified firmware.
